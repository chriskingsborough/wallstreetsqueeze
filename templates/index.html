        How did you find your last stock? Our guess, if you're honest with yourself,
        is it was probably by accident. Maybe a friend suggested it, maybe you heard it
        in passing on a podcast, or maybe even on Reddit. At Wall Street Squeeze,
        we think you can do better and we're here to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're here to help you find better ideas. We provide collections of stocks
        based on fundamentals and momentum indicators. So next top you're ready to make
        an investment decision, start with info, not a tip from your friend from college.

        Always thought screening stocks was too hard to do on your own? Wall Street Squeeze
        makes it easy with our own collections. Looking for high dividend stocks, check out
        our high dividend collection. What about stocks that have dipped below their 50 and
        200 day moving averages, we've got you covered there too. Even if you're looking for
        something simpler, like is Apple part of the Nasdaq 100, we've got you covered there
        too with our Nasdaq 100 collection.
